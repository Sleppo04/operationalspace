=== INTRODUCTION ===============================================================

The OperationalSpace Programming language shall have a name. It is not a
general-purpose scripting language but rather a scripting language specialized
on re-occurring calls to the same script.

It will feature:
* compile-time includes
* static typing
* custom data types
* functions
* variables persistent in-between runs



=== STRUCTURE ==================================================================

Scripts written in the language have to follow a specific structure in order to
be properly recognized by the compiler. The structure is roughly as follows:

* List of includes which are required by the program
* List of functions declarations
* The "main" program code in global space
* EOF

Embedding the programming language is a two-step process. First, you have to
provide a method for the computer to turn the script into a format it can
understand and execute. For that, the compiler is required. The compiler
roughly works as follows:

* Source is given to the Lexer
* Lexer converts the source into a stream of tokens
* Parser parses the token stream into an abstract syntax tree
* Compiler compiles the abstract syntax tree into executable bytecode and embeds
  metadata about the script if necessary
