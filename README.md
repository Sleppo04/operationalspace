# OperationalSpace
OperationalSace is a game about space exploration, epic battles, resource management,
and **programming**. Yes, that's correct: you have to plan your ships actions
and program them in advance. Ships can be upgraded using different *modules*,
each one having a different effect on the ship stats, adding to the strategy factor of the game.

The goal of the game is to collect and control as many ressources as efficiently as possible.
